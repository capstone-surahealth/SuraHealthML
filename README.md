  SuraHealth
Abstract:
  This project is important to complete. Project background information highlights the importance of timely access to emergency medical services and the challenges many cities in Indonesia face in ensuring this access. The team wanted to address this issue because they believe that access to emergency medical services is a fundamental right, and it is important to ensure that every citizen can access these services when needed.

The aim of this project is to identify the number of emergency rooms available in Surakarta, their location, and the capacity of these rooms. The team will also analyze emergency room accessibility for different populations and identify access barriers. Finally, the team will provide recommendations to increase the availability and accessibility of emergency medical services in Surakarta.

## Business Understanding
> Problem Statements
  Recently, People had difficulty getting first aid especially when someone is in another area. We innovated to make an application for one of the cities in Indonesia,  that is Surakarta regarding the availability of ambulances and/or first aid through the chat feature with a general practitioner at the nearest hospital using hospital recommendations location-based. Apart from that, this project was also initiated because of the difficulty for the community in finding information on the capacity of beds or inpatient rooms and hospital emergency rooms. Our team also hopes that this application can make it easier for the people of Surakarta to receive information on the location of the nearest hospital and the first treatment that can be done based on the patient's condition at that time.
This project aims to analyze the availability of emergency rooms in Surakarta using data from SIRANAP, the National Hospital Registry database. The problem statement is that Surakarta, like many other cities in Indonesia, faces challenges in ensuring all residents have access to emergency medical services. The research questions focused on the distribution of emergency rooms in Surakarta, the capacity of the rooms, and how accessible they are for different populations.

> Goals
  This project has had a good impact on the community, especially around Surakarta.
- The difficulty of finding the nearest hospital according to the type and taste of BPJS can be overcome. This project can provide recommendations for the closest hospital and identify the number of emergency rooms available in Surakarta, their location, and the capacity of the room.
- Difficulty getting hospital contacts can be overcome. Apart from recommending hospitals, we also provide hospital profiles, one of which is a Whatsapp number that can be contacted.
- Limited knowledge of the general public regarding initial steps that can be given to relatives if an incident is resolved. We also designed a <first aid kit> that provides initial maintenance information that can be performed while waiting for the repair team to arrive.
